## üß† Key Objectives

- Clean and structure raw game data from Syracuse Women‚Äôs Lacrosse 2024
- Identify top performers based on goals, assists, shots, and caused turnovers
- Use visuals like stacked bars, donut charts, histograms, and boxplots to derive insights
- Demonstrate how AI (LLM-based assistance) can accelerate analytics workflows

---

## üí° Highlights from Analysis

- **Top Scorer:** Emma Ward with 30 goals and 46 assists (76 points)
- **High-Efficiency Shooters:** Players with SH% > 0.4 were found to contribute more consistently
- **CT Leaders:** Defensive strength analyzed using donut chart for "Caused Turnovers"
- **Shot Efficiency:** Boxplots revealed that high shot volume doesn't always equate to high scoring

---

## ü§ñ How AI & LLMs Were Used

- Prompted AI (ChatGPT) to generate Python scripts for:
  - Cleaning inconsistent columns
  - Handling NaN values
  - Creating custom plots (stacked bars, donut charts)
- Iteratively debugged KeyErrors and type mismatches using AI guidance
- Used AI to interpret unclear field names in sports analytics context
- Co-developed storytelling visualizations and documentation

---

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pandas**, **seaborn**, **matplotlib**, **plotly**
- AI-powered assistance using **ChatGPT** for code generation and debugging
